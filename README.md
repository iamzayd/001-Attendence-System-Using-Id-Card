# Attendence-System-Using-Id-Card

This project fo attendence system uses students ID card in which there is barcode behind the ID card which once scanned to the camera take a unique ID called as "PRN" 
and saves it in a Dataframe and later is saved to a csv file so teachers can have an additional copy of the csv file in their desktop.

After we made a dataframe with dates of classes where students attended class, we now calculated the attendence percentage of each student

And we can also find how much attendence percentage the given student is having. (and displays if it is above 75% or not.)

And a graph is also displayed displaying the attendence percentage of each student in the class.
